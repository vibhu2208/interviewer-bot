# Context Pack - Crossover: Hire - L2 - Sourcing - LinkedIn

## Business Context

The LinkedIn Sourcing module enables Crossover to efficiently post and manage job listings on LinkedIn's platform. It addresses the need to reach high-quality professional candidates through LinkedIn's job marketplace, supporting both free job listings and paid job slots. The module automatically synchronizes job postings from Crossover's internal systems to LinkedIn, ensuring consistent and up-to-date job information across platforms.

## Functional Context

The module provides automated job feed generation and publishing capabilities for LinkedIn integration. Key functions include:

- Generating XML job feeds compatible with LinkedIn's bulk job posting API
- Supporting both free job listings and paid job slots
- Handling location-based and remote job postings
- Managing job metadata including skills, experience levels, and industries
- Tracking application sources through UTM parameters

### Important Functional Decisions

1. Support for both free listings and job slots with different tagging strategies
2. Inclusion of master brand concept for unified company representation
3. Automated handling of remote vs. location-based positions
4. Standardized job description formatting with consistent branding elements

## Technical Context

### Tech Stack

- Node.js with TypeScript
- AWS Lambda for serverless execution
- AWS S3 for feed storage
- Salesforce integration for job data
- XML processing using xmlbuilder2

### Data Model

```mermaid

    class LinkedInConfiguration {
        +String LinkedIn_Job_Tag_Free_Listing__c
        +String LinkedIn_Job_Tag_Slot__c
        +String Master_Brand_Id__c
    }
    class LinkedInCampaign {
        +String Id
        +String InternalId__c
        +String Type
        +String Ad_Title__c
        +String Description
        +Pipeline__r PipelineInfo
    }
    class Country {
        +String Code__c
        +String Label
        +String Currency__c
    }
    LinkedInConfiguration "1" --> "*" LinkedInCampaign
    LinkedInCampaign "*" --> "1" Country
```

### Important Technical Decisions

1. XML feed generation happens in memory before S3 upload for better performance
2. Feed generation is scheduled via CloudWatch Events
3. Separate buckets for output and access logging
4. Standardized error handling with detailed logging

### Established Practices

1. Strict type checking for LinkedIn enums (job functions, industries, etc.)
2. Comprehensive unit testing for feed generation
3. Structured logging for monitoring and debugging
4. Configuration management through Salesforce
