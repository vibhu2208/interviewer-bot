Interview: Lucas Pereira
Wed, Jun 25, 2025

0:01 - Serban Petrescu
to actually re-shoot it for product people, but I think it gives some context about the company and myself and so on.

0:10 - Lucas Pereira
So, did you have a chance to take a quick look at it? Yeah, sure. I watched it a few times, and I'd like just to confirm how I pronounced your name.

0:22 - Serban Petrescu
It's Sherburn, right? Yes, yes, exactly. Okay. Yeah. Awesome. So, I'll spend maybe five minutes monologuing a bit about what's different about this role, why it exists, and so on. And feel free to interrupt me, feel free to ask questions. This process should be equally about me finding out stuff about you to see if you're a fit, but also for you to find out stuff about us to see if we are a fit.

0:48 - Serban Petrescu
So feel free to ask any kind of questions.

0:51 - Serban Petrescu
Okay, perfect. Okay, so about this role. Essentially, my department acts like an in-house outsourcer, I would call it. Call it. Basically, there are all these sister companies like Learnify, Alpha, GT School, whatever, Crossover, so on. So there are a lot of sister companies like this. All of them are owned by the same person. So basically, the management is shared. It's like purely a juridical differentiation between all these sister companies. But each of them has a business. And the founder of this company, of all the companies and the owner, decided that instead of each of them embedding software engineering capacity within them, because all of them have software-related businesses, like their businesses are, for example, Alpha is a school. It's a physical school, but it has a lot of software that it needs. It needs a lot of custom software to run the school, because it's not a typical school. It's a re-envisions, basically, the way in which it runs the school, so they have some specific software that they need. So instead of Alpha having software engineers on their side, all of them are kind of agglomerated in my department. So that's how my department works. Now, to be able to build software, we need a product leader, typically. So we need somebody who decides what we should be building, how we should be building it, and so on. Because the engineers, of course, can decide on the hows on the technical side, but they have no idea about the actual business. So until now, how this has worked is that these sister companies provide us with the PMs, with product leaders that know the business, theoretically, and can provide this leadership. Now, this has two problems. One is that many sister companies do not have such PMs, so they don't have product leaders to be able to actually do this kind of stuff. They have CEOs, they have support personnel, they have other types of people, they don't have software product leaders. And then it's challenging for them to actually create such role. On the other hand, for the ones that have such a role internally, they kind of suck, basically. So the reason why they suck is that we have had a lot of product leaders essentially being feature factories. They only care about shipping stuff, like deliverables, having stuff to report in the weekly demo meeting that they have with their CEOs or whatever. So, okay, we build this new feature, this new capability, and less so about what are the needs of our customers, what are the actual problems that we want to solve for the end user, and also less so about becoming a domain expert. Like, we have discovered that the people that are driving, for example, products for Learn with AI, which is an educational company that we work for, have very little knowledge about education. And they are not spending time learning about education, spending time micromanaging the engineering team and creating figmas and stuff like that, but they are not actually getting the knowledge about education.

4:03 - Lucas Pereira
Genuinely, that was my main interest in the job. When I saw in the job description only the outcome and not the roadmap, like Portuguese would say, like feature developers as well, I really agree, I really enjoyed this mindset in the company, uh, and then saying you, uh, with for us these, I am really excited. I mean, I'm going to say, uh, later, but it's how I, how I believe that how should be product management. And I, I am the same page. I don't agree with the, the, by the book in the market right now, like, uh, in my opinion, my humble opinion, we're having the product management, uh, market is like a featureable mindset. And not like the outcome mindset. Yes, exactly.

4:50 - Unidentified Speaker
Exactly.

4:50 - Serban Petrescu
So how I envision this role and what I want this role to be different, let's say, is that we need to do stakeholder management. We need to talk with the leadership from the customers. We need to talk with the people from the school, for example, and so on. But it doesn't mean that we need to just blindly follow whatever they are saying, right? The role of the product manager or the product leader in this case is to take all that input to become a domain expert independently and filter all the input through his own lens and then come up with a product strategy that works, that delivers outcomes for the students, for the customers, for whatever, for the end user and somehow to be able to also manage the relationship with the stakeholders if we don't necessarily follow what they are suggesting to the letter. So to be able to make a case and be rational about how we should proceed and deliver value without essentially upsetting everybody in the process. So it's kind of sensitive in this direction, but I think it's necessary in a company to be able to do this. Apart from this stakeholder management skill, let's say, that I'm looking for, I'm looking for people that can become domain experts, that are interested in learning new stuff across different domains, and then encapsulating their findings in documents like this one from the assessment where other people can inspect and comment and tell you, okay, this is wrong or this is right or whatever. Because I think this will drive alignment and it will make our job a lot easier. And then maybe to also use AI with these documents to kind of vet your decisions, to help you make decisions, to help you validate that you're on the right track. And then once we have such a document and such knowledge and we discuss with stakeholders, like I said, to define requirements, to keep the right level of detail. I don't want to blindly, all the time, just go in there and write exhaustively all edge cases and all requirements functionally, exactly everything, how it should be on the UI, where should be the settings icon, how should be the settings input fields for whatever kind of setting. We don't care mostly about stuff like that. But in other cases, it might be right. I don't know, the feed of Facebook or LinkedIn or Twitter or whatever, probably you don't really care about how things are laid out and so on because it's the central flow of the app. But if it's a less important screen, you can just ask the engineers to do an average job, and it will be OK. And we can either iterate if needed. That's basically how I want to envision this.

7:33 - Lucas Pereira
Sure, but just I think it's going to be a good match. I can share a little bit. Bit about my profile during what I can bring to the table about this first subject you brought like with stakeholder. I almost over five years like in huge companies in Latin America so usually as a product manager I have is the inside stakeholders as directors managers and stuff and of course the engineer team but I also worked in a consulting a few years ago and I was like this profile, I had some external clients that I had to own the roadmap, but own the strategy about why we are doing this and convince them that it's a good choice. It's something that I try to bring to the table also inside huge companies, despite of being more difficult because you have sometimes top-down. But I would like to say this. And right now, in the past one year and a half. I'm working also with external provider for my product and this is stakeholder management. It's like I can say it's in my day in day out and I can guarantee that I can bring these skills as well.

8:55 - Serban Petrescu
Awesome. Okay, before we go into that, just to finish my monologue, what other stuff apart from stakeholder management and and building a domain and deriving these requirements for the MVP. The main thing is I want this person then to have a very data-driven mindset such that we launch an MVP, and then we have clear success criteria, success criteria that, by the way, we can define. So that's kind of the good thing about how we work is that we typically define what success looks like, but it has to be measurable and convincing. And then we are held accountable to what we defined. Basically, I want this person to obsess around data, collecting data from our users, collecting feedback from our users, and continually iterating and having a loop where we constantly improve the product such that we converge on the right outcome. Basically, if I want to use a metaphor here, it's like if we're playing darts, I don't really care how close the initial throw of the dart lands on the bullseye, I care that we throw it as quick as possible, and then we can throw subsequent darts. I can pick it up and throw it again. Subsequently, Sergeant, each time we converge closer and closer to the bullseye. That's the kind of mentality that I want to have, rather than what we have right now, which is we spend six months or nine months or whatever polishing at Infinity MVP, that when we launch, it's a complete...

10:29 - Lucas Pereira
We like to say, do the cupcake, not the full cake. And we start to take feedback. It's perfect. I'm aligned. Awesome. Yeah, so that's more or less it.

10:40 - Serban Petrescu
There is a small question in the requirements about using AI. So there is just why I included that is because I do want people that are at least open and enthusiastic about using AI in their work because the engineers are moving really fast because of AI we use. Cursor and Windsurf and other tools in this area. I would want this person as well to use AI tools as much as possible to get the most out of their working day, let's say, and focus on what's really valuable, not on the groundwork type stuff.

11:18 - Lucas Pereira
Sure. I see. Today, it's mandatory. It's not nice to have anymore. In my opinion, everyone is learning really fast how it can change. But for me as a product manager, nowadays, it's part of my day in, day out in the product. But as an assistant as well, it helps me a lot. Awesome. Great.

11:40 - Serban Petrescu
OK, so now the floor is yours.

11:42 - Serban Petrescu
You can tell me more about your experience that you think makes you a great fit for this role. And then we'll go through a few examples and scenarios that you encountered in your experience.

11:56 - Unidentified Speaker
OK.

11:56 - Lucas Pereira
I prepared a few bullets I'd like to share with you and get your feedback. Presenting myself as I started my career and why I'm here as a product manager nowadays. But it's talk a lot about my profile. And some cases that how I use AI, my day in, day out, like if a system tool, but also in the product. And I separate a few questions for you in the end, if I have time. I would like to hear your opinion. Yeah, it would be these three moments.

12:36 - Unidentified Speaker
OK? Yeah, that's perfectly fine.

12:38 - Lucas Pereira
Let's go for it. So Shabnam, I started my career as an entrepreneur. So I'm hearing you say, and I saw in the job description, Trilogy needs a lot of ownership. And as an entrepreneur I was abroad. I'm from Brazil and there was an intensive entrepreneur experience in Portugal and that was my my first like learning that if you don't have ownership you like you don't pay the bills. So it was different from a traditional career and was my first contact with digital products and stuff that was around 2019. I was as you I was right about working remotely. So in COVID, I started to work remotely. I got in a consulting, and then in Itaú, which is the largest bank in Latin America. And working remotely, I really enjoyed. I was, I mean, get great feedbacks, great result, great performance, but the flexible of working remotely, I really enjoyed. And that changed my mindset that we can be productive working remotely. And so Since then, I made this transition from being an entrepreneur and then working in a small company, in a small consulting, to go to a huge company that Zitao was in 2021 as a product manager. And the outcome in that moment was, how can we launch a new full landscape of products that was insurance in the largest bank in South America, DigitalSane, we have in the physical store. It was an amazing moment. We launched a few digital end-to-end journey, get amazing results. We got from completely from scratch, but it's a huge company. We have some process and I wasn't in the best place. I would like to work talking about flexible and speeding. We have a lot of... Is it also because of the decision making?

14:44 - Serban Petrescu
Because I know taking decisions in big companies, especially banks, which are very regulated and so on, you need to get a million approvals for anything that you're doing.

14:55 - Lucas Pereira
Yeah, something like this and you don't have necessarily the product mindset in the top leadership. So, it's a company like we have a hundred years and we are doing digital products since like 10 years ago, so it's difficult to change the mindset. What I'm really grateful about the experience was amazing. I got some successful there. I got another scope, was beyond banking. And I'd like to highlight, because I started as an insurance, understanding about 10 different products insurance. And then beyond banking was like HR products, ERP products. And I was kind of forced to understanding different kind of user needs. And also different products. So quick learning was something that I had to bring in Itaú. And then I have this opportunity to start at companies I'm currently working. And it was something like this. Lucas come here to entrepreneur about payroll. So usually now coming to 2024 and this year, working with payroll was they gave me like a white paper. Whatever you believe is trustable, it's going to be a great outcome. And then I just end the thing.

16:19 - Serban Petrescu
This was truly a 0 to 1 scenario. Basically, you went from nothing. Well, you went from the white paper to something.

16:28 - Lucas Pereira
I'm curious what's the 1. Yeah, was literally the 0. We had a, and even they squared the developers, and it was like just the product, OK, figure out the outcome. For a budget and because we were missing a payment feature for payroll to pay the employees that we every competitor has. So it was something let's try to to solve this pain but try to do something different. So Stone it's a B2B company mainly in POS it's one of the largest in Latin America and we have a banking. Today I'm a lead product manager in the banking era and the discovery conclusion like one month after it was doing the payment experience is not enough. We have a gap, we have an opportunity solving the relationship between employer and employee, getting a workforce management solution. As Square POS is doing USA and Toast as well, they are doing really well and they have successful penetrating in SMB. I brought this idea. We evaluate how can we do, how would be the outcome. We brought an external company to do a white label and like getting a quick cupcake and not the full cake. And like one month later, we have the first client using a workforce management solution inside a banking company. It was kind of different in Brazil. We don't have this kind of business model here. Since then, we're talking about May of last year, I developed a product view of talking about two years of a full ecosystem of products. And nowadays, we have over 100 clients, almost 200 in the workforce management. And in the payroll experience, we have almost a billion reais every month getting paid as we launch First of all, the payment experience and the HR that the workforce management is getting right after. Was my mainly my mainly experience talking about like zero to one. We we are. We right now we are. We are getting a new product right here that is the employee account in this. Is ecosystem and What was that is a great experience because it being an entrepreneur inside the company. But what I miss and what I really make my attention in Trilogy, it's the velocity you look like have, owning the outcome. Because here, I think it's better, the product culture. But I think I can do better. I think I don't do my best. Because I don't want. It's because we have some culture by here that we don't have like the product mindset as you have like to do something really faster using AI more than I need, more than I would like, And that's my quick overview.

19:49 - Serban Petrescu
I'm curious, how does that translate practically? What do you feel in your day-to-day work that is holding you back exactly? How does this culture Yeah, influence you.

20:02 - Unidentified Speaker
OK.

20:02 - Lucas Pereira
Sometimes we can influence, and sometimes it's difficult. A quick example. I wrote that I use lovable in the L2 prototype faster. We have a process here. Maybe we spend two, three weeks. A design can have the final prototype. And we have a lack of velocity here that we, since I'm starting to use lovable. I can have this conversation with design like one day we have a more realistic idea and we can deep dive faster and shorter this full life cycle of development. It's an example.

20:45 - Serban Petrescu
And you think this is because of the rigid processes that are in place at Stone or is it because of the lack of openness to disrupt how things are done or why do you still have this long like you can show them right like look this lovable thing and to chat with it it creates already a prototype that works right and engineers can just take that and maybe refurbish it a bit and we're done.

21:17 - Lucas Pereira
Why go through this two week long cycle? It's a part of like security to using external tools so they understand the outcome But the restrictive thing to follow the tools that we can use, it's a concern a little bit for... The bureaucracy is bigger than the wish to do some faster. Yeah, but I kind of understand that, right?

21:49 - Serban Petrescu
If you're in a financial space, securities, kind of something that you always have to think of, right? It's understandable. Yeah.

22:00 - Lucas Pereira
Banking, it's a lot, and mainly HR products. We are talking about sensitive information, and this in Brazil, it's really tough. But it's a good culture. I don't have straight complaint. It's just more highlighting your culture than everything. And I separate some use cases of AI that I use nowadays as lecturing. Share, if you don't mind. So I just thought, do you mind if I just share a piece of paper? It's really quickly.

22:32 - Serban Petrescu
It's OK.

22:33 - Serban Petrescu
It's OK. Definitely. Share it.

22:35 - Unidentified Speaker
OK.

22:36 - Lucas Pereira
I just took this. I have almost a year, so I can share. We don't have problems. So first of all, starting this discovery and delivering process, we got the inspiration around the world. So we looked at Square in USA. That's a Brazilian HR tech. Revolut, I think you know as well, it's the main tech in Europe. Itaú, which was the company I was, and also BTG, which was another huge banking. And we got the value proposition talking about employees in each company. Then we bring the current vision. So we have workforce management solution, payment solution, and we are going to an employee solution, and everything connected. Talking about this full workflow and not just a feature, trying to solve the employee workflow. Here, it's trying to approach a customer-centric approach. So sorry because it's in Portuguese, but it's just a quick translation of what needs they have and what the employees need. And just to finish, I'd like to show that we have five big workflows in this environment. And since the beginning, we show how could be this product in the future, like visually saying. So the employee, we are talking about a solution that provides for 800,000 clients. So the workforce management, the payment solution, selling benefits because it's a natural cross-selling. Also reports for decision-making, owner improve the decision-making. And finally, the employee account. So I can see the workforce management and payment solutions. And always was step by step by step with technology. I'm really concerned about executing a nice discovery, but some really hands-on that we can execute. So this was with my partner in technology here and we like we provide a non-exhaustive draw that how can we consume this information for this this partnership this external provider doing a rubric and consuming by apis uh and how how can each uh solution consume this this workflow technically saying and alavancas it's like outcome what's the outcome for initiative so uh workforce management we have like reduce of journey we have a cross-selling payment paid me to have like a banking floating I mean we have several benefits and uh that's how how I was trying to organize the the vision type to so we we can align with the top management company and since then we are working almost a year And we also, of course, calibrate the strategy, but it's an art style that we are following since the beginning.

26:10 - Unidentified Speaker
Awesome.

26:10 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah.

26:11 - Serban Petrescu
I think elements of that is definitely something that we want to do as well. We don't do planning for such long periods like a year. We typically do it at a quarter level, and we want something similar, like what are the outcomes, what are the results we want to see, what's the main approach, what are other people doing? For example, in education, about one of our educational products. There are a million products in education that do outside of our realm, let's say, everything, basically. So what are other people doing? How are they approaching it? How are we different? Stuff like that. These kind of things, I do want a product leader to be doing. And it's not being done enough right now, but with this role, I want to make it more and more usual thing, that we do this discovery, we do this ideation, In the end, we drive some outcomes and we have a plan that everybody kind of aligns to.

27:09 - Lucas Pereira
Perfect. And I totally agree with you. We do something like this, a product view, but we continue pivoting this strategy doing because we start to delivering and understanding the customer wants something different to solve the pain. So an example, when we launched the workforce management, the employee, clocking with a pin, 1, 2, 3, 4. And then we're getting a lot of owners complain that it's not trustable because the employee can share the password. So we got the feature of face recognition. We choose some hardware that can have a great camera. We will find this. And it's a feature that's completely different from the beginning. So something I really believe in this mindset of, OK, we enough style, but it's not a real plan, because it's not a project, it's a product.

28:05 - Serban Petrescu
I'm curious, from the execution side of this, when you started building the actual features, not the North Star, but actually starting to decide on the feature set, on how this product will look like, what was the most difficult decision to make?

28:24 - Lucas Pereira
Do the payment experience was easier because it's a feature inside our bank account. So we do the traditional discovery and it's a feature that we were converging about three percent and now it's in 12. Like we're really satisfied but the main difficulty was convincing internally that using external provider for a different solution would be better for the product and because we couldn't anticipate this cupcake product that we were talking. So this means not just convinced, but security talking. We have a lot of discussion, but how can we execute this? A different company providing a part of the journey was difficult, was hard. We involve a lot of engineers talking. It's a new product. We don't have any in the company, like consulting external provider, but we had useful. We spent maybe a month in the final engineered drone, but this product is in production and working for several months. How did you know this is the right way of going?

29:38 - Serban Petrescu
Because the easy way would have been to just say, okay, let's just build all of this ourselves. We wouldn't have had to go through all the security discussions. We would wouldn't have had to discuss for your stakeholders to convince them that this probably this was the first time in the history of the bank where something like this happened because they're very conservative so I know that they don't easily agree to an option like this. So how did you know that this is the right approach versus building it in-house or any other option?

30:14 - Lucas Pereira
Perfect question and I had to answer a lot inside the company. I tried to show how difficult would be build a software from completely zero of workforce management. Different from countries like US or Ireland, I live a bit there. Here in Brazil, we don't pay per hour, we pay per month. And doing this, we have several rules, strict rules about doing this calculation. And we have like the government, in the end of the day, The software that provided it, they are really complex and difficult to build. So from the moment that we present this until the moment that we could get the first client, we have like maybe a month. So my thesis was, guys, if we have quick feedback about the customer, we can show that it's not just a great presentation, but also shows a real solution. And the amount of money, the amount of investment was just maybe 20% of the cost of a full square in stone. So cost, the financial thing, and the time. The time to market was the main goal here to convince the stakeholder.

31:39 - Serban Petrescu
Got it. Okay. Maybe going a bit more in detail about how you knew it was a success? Because you said at the beginning that this was a success.

31:53 - Lucas Pereira
How do you know that it was a success? So we are looking for several KPIs of these clients that are using, like churn, like increase of using our financial products as the payment of the payroll. And when we compare, like we have a statistical team, we separate control group and observated group. And we realize we have better results, better KPIs, like improvement of sometimes 30%, 40% in the average balance. It's an important KPI in banking, because if you don't have a high average balance is because your client's sending money to your competitor. And checking these KPIs, and of course, shareless score, net promote score, we are really solving a real problem. Banking KPIs and customer KPIs, we are getting successful in this project.

33:02 - Serban Petrescu
Okay. Can you give me an example of a case where a KPI wasn't exactly where you wanted it. I don't believe, like I discussed at the beginning with the dart, I really don't believe that you just threw the dart and it was bullseye from the first throw.

33:24 - Lucas Pereira
That's never happening. Sure. We were really optimistic about the conversion and activation, conversion and engagement. And this was tricky because in the beginning, you were looking at conversion. So the client went to the end and purchased the product. But in this particular product, we have a gap between conversion and engagement. And we faced this. We have about 30% not engagement number. And that was motivate us to including having some actions of improving onboarding and also getting a loose AI. I'm going to explain later. But that's a classical KPI that we had to interpret it better. Conversion is not the same as activating. So to not get a number, a fake number, a fake message, we start to stop looking at conversion and start to look at activation.

34:32 - Serban Petrescu
And how did you diagnose the problem? Any problem in your KPIs. It's not just that you're looking at the wrong KPI. It's also typically that something is going on with your product. Users buy it and don't want to use it because, I know, it's too confusing. It's whatever.

34:51 - Lucas Pereira
So how do you diagnose the root cause of this activation drop-off?

34:55 - Lucas Pereira
The main point of the lack of activation here was the difficulty to finish the onboarding. So each company has a particular situation, like how many employees they have, how many is a restaurant, it's a bar, it's a retail, like they have different needs in the onboarding and we replaced a rule-based chatbot for an AI to better support this client during the onboarding.

35:25 - Serban Petrescu
I want to decompose this a bit because I think there are two, maybe three things here. On one hand is pinpointing the right cause, like how did you know that onboarding is the thing? What kind of tools did you use to diagnose it properly? And then we should discuss about the solution space, how you pruned it, how did you converge on a specific solution?

35:55 - Lucas Pereira
Okay. We use like meta-based amplitude tools to understand the completely funnel and we realize some specific parts of the onboarding like set up the work journey, set up the rules about paying the employees. These specific journeys around six, seven steps. We have like a main gap in two, three steps. And realizing this, we have some customers interviews with this client that drop off and we got this. We used to have a one-size-fits-all. We believe in one-size-fits-all journey, and we understand that it's not like this. We have to try to be predictive, understanding the profile of each customer, and then provide a proper journey. And by the way...

36:47 - Serban Petrescu
Based on the data, you derived that there are multiple segments or cohorts or whatever in the customer that have different needs.

36:57 - Lucas Pereira
And by the way, I saw a little bit this in crossover, when you say find the best jobs in the world from Volta Redonda, which is the city I am, and they say perhaps you have something that you can... You got my attention in the landing page. It's a small example of predictive.

37:20 - Serban Petrescu
I really thought it was smarter. Awesome. Okay, so I think I'm fairly clear on how you diagnosed it, then it seems like your solution anyway had multiple steps to it. First, you said it's a segmentation problem. We need to segment our users better and provide a more specific journey. Then you said, OK, the chatbot, which had this predefined structure, is not the right solution. So you kind of pinpointed that as one of the root causes. I'm curious, how did you on the specific solutions? Because you can imagine multiple solutions to this, like wizards and other kind of stuff. So how did you land on this specific solution? And how did you know at the end that it works? Because that's also important. Once you picked it and did something, how do you know that it works?

38:15 - Lucas Pereira
The rule-based chatbot, we were tracking the number, because when you have a situation, you open the ticket. And if the rule-based chatbot didn't solve your problem, you go to a human ticket. So a human going to support you. When it got for AI, we reduced the number of human tickets attending. So we realized that that was our successful KPI, reduce the number of humans attending. And of course, we have, like, in the end of the journey, How easy, we ask this, how easy was the finish to this journey? Also in the payment, and we target like a great score.

39:00 - Unidentified Speaker
These two.

39:01 - Lucas Pereira
Yeah, mainly was that KPI and the journey. We are doing this right now, like trying to do this prediction. And we expected it to reduce the number of drop-off. Like it's one step before, I would like my customer even need to open a ticket, even need to talk with the AI, so it's one step before. They complement themselves in the workflow. I think I got the answer to how do you measure the success.

39:33 - Serban Petrescu
I think that's fairly clear at this point. I'm not sure I got the answer of how do you pick this specific solution. Did you do a research to explore the whole solution space? Any problem has a solution space and I think one of the core skills that you need as a PM is to be able to prune that solution space until you have just a finite set of solutions and then you can do kind of a breakdown or analysis or whatever to pick one of them.

40:07 - Lucas Pereira
Shaban, getting really honest and sincerely with you, I do the old and good stakeholder management like I got one step before and talk with the leadership of support in Stone, which is a company with 15,000 employees. And I didn't invent the AI support Lucy inside Stone. So what did I discover? We were the second or third product, around like 13, 14, that start with Lucy AI. So I didn't have a higher expertise, how, how to do this. And I learned like six months ago, how can we connect with the stone AI? So I'm mapping the, the main pain points of customer success, uh, to connect with them. So basically it was mapping that the company has a investment in that. And then how can we do like doing my work as a product, like, uh, mapping the gaps for, for executing this was basically, yeah, that's a very approach, right?

41:12 - Serban Petrescu
So you had a problem and you discovered that there is already a solution within your organization for this specific problem. So you didn't explore the problem, the solution space further because you already had the solution, basically.

41:28 - Lucas Pereira
So you just adopted it. That is reasonable. OK? And yeah, I think what can I say about this specifically using off-AI, like Lavabo and every, it's something I think maybe two years ago, I don't have the context, even because they are completely new, but I'm really open-minded to learn things new. I think I worked with four or five different subjects, and I have this interest about learning new things and applying. I don't get strict with... I'm not a fan of the solution. I'm a fan of solving the pain problem.

42:06 - Serban Petrescu
Yeah. Good. Maybe a slightly related question around a situation where the solution that you proposed didn't work. You built something, you had a clear hypothesis, you thought about it, you were fairly confident in the answer. For example, this Lucy could have been one if it didn't work. Say, okay, this is the right answer, you roll it out and it's not. It's taking your metric downwards rather than upwards. Because there are cases when you throw this dart, from time to time, it will be worse than the throw that you did before. You didn't learn something properly, or you inferred something, extrapolated something that isn't correct, maybe.

42:56 - Lucas Pereira
I can say, I think the example of how the employee, how thousands of employees, they're going to punch, clocking the time and I was really confident about taking the ping because it would be easier and it's less the the experience it's easier because you don't have to take the camera and get the selfie but I was wrong like the the employer the owner say I don't mind if get a higher a more time experience because gonna be more secure gonna gonna be gonna be trustable on the pin, and I got two steps back. We had to pivotate.

43:39 - Serban Petrescu
This was not necessarily because of a metric or a KPI. Fundamentally, it was because you didn't align with a stakeholder. You thought you empathized, let's say, with your end user, the employee in this case, because he was the one entering the pin and doing the time tracking, but you didn't empathize with the boss of the employee. Sure, exactly.

44:04 - Lucas Pereira
And one thing happened as well, at the moment that we delivered, that moment started to develop, doing the face recognition would be spending more time than just the pin. So this influenced me a little bit to do this because, okay, let's finish the cupcake and then the cake. I was with this mindset, but I was wrong. I should have...

44:30 - Serban Petrescu
The goods need about delivering the cupcake first in this case is that you didn't waste that much. If you have done reverse and created the face recognition and then you will get feedback that people aren't using it because it's too complicated and then you have an adoption problem or a friction problem, it would have been worse to simplify that because you just did the investment and now you have to throw it away.

44:55 - Lucas Pereira
Yeah, I would never have been sure that face recognition would be better. Right. I'm curious, how did you manage the relationship with the engineering team in this case?

45:05 - Serban Petrescu
Even though it was a small thing, you still had to ask them to throw stuff away, like this pin thing, to throw it away and replace it with the face recognition. How do you manage situations like this, where you build something, you realize you were wrong, you now have to rebuild it, throw it away, re-whatever, and you have to deal with the fact that some people invested time and effort in building it originally, and they might not be the most motivated to delete it and recreate it from scratch.

45:38 - Lucas Pereira
I really believe contests matter. So I'm not just a product person. And the engineer manager that works with me, he's not just technical. So he knows a little bit of the product. And I know a lot about the technical. We can talk the same language. So when I explained to him why we took the decision, he completely understood. And we don't have this lack of motivation, because it's like, OK, maybe in your place, I would do the same thing. And the same is for me. Sometimes we had to pivotate the engineer decision. And when he gave me the contest, I was on the same page. OK, I remember in September, we did this for this reason. I was with you. I was on the same page, and I understand what happens. At the end of the day, I think we spend a little bit more time during the process giving contests, but this helps to get still the motivation. I see you told in the video you spend 10% of the time, 20% of the time aligning with the team, what you're doing, get refinement. I think this is a great moment to align this kind of decision, and we don't have this kind of lack of motivation.

46:56 - Serban Petrescu
Yeah, I agree. So transparency and giving the proper context and explaining and so on is definitely crucial to be able to keep people motivated, right? I think the biggest reason why people become demotivated in such contexts is when the changes are seemingly random, right? And you're just building something, deleting, building, deleting, and there is no purpose, no silver line is just randomly going in zigzag with no no overall direction in sight.

47:25 - Lucas Pereira
Yeah, I truly believe the developers here, they ask for the last retro. They say, Lucas, I know it's far from the execution, but we want a monthly schedule for you. Bring the discovery. You can bring what you are thinking, what you are wondering for next three months. And we are doing just one hour monthly. But I show them what we are thinking about this and it's really positive. It's not like a refinement officially one, but they feel a part of the strategy. They feel they were involved. Yeah, that's the word. Awesome.

48:03 - Serban Petrescu
Okay, kind of my last question in this area is around how do you manage upwards your stakeholders, especially in cases like this? Well, this is too small maybe, but if you had other bigger cases where you build something and it wasn't really It didn't really help your outcome, so now you have to pivot. And when you pivot like this for leadership, for example, sometimes some leaders equate this with waste. They say, okay, we built this thing, and now you're telling me we have to pivot so all this money that we burnt with this thing is gone. We are not getting anything from it. How do you manage situations like this where you have to do this kind of pivoting and you now have to ask for, be more budget to do the pivoting. Most stakeholders, most leaders that I know would first ask you, OK, didn't you try to polish or risk in a bit what you did already?

49:05 - Serban Petrescu
Why do we need this radical 90-degree change in your direction?

49:11 - Lucas Pereira
I'm a professional. I'm not afraid of having difficult conversations. Session, to communicate hard decisions. I know it's difficult. Maybe it's the most difficult part. But I don't try to be polite a lot, to go for another side. I go straight to the point. But I also like to try to understand what to define a few months ago. Usually, we have quarter key results. And we have like the main decisions in that moment. So nothing was executed by only my mind. It was something shared. It was a decision sharing. And of course, not running off my responsibility, but usually works like this kind of statement. I'm right now facing this because we didn't improve the number of clients, the growth as the leadership expected, but we wasn't for this specifically KPI in this quarter. It was for conversion. And we increased to 3% for 12. So I'm defending the execution using this number and realigning. Remember then, three months ago, that was the statement. And I'm completely open to change the statement for the next three months. I think transparency and be really straight to the point, clarity, that helps.

50:42 - Serban Petrescu
Yeah, so what I hear from this is basically avoid situations where you do stuff in the dark and then your stakeholders are surprised that this was even a thing, right? Because presenting to them that we failed in doing something and they weren't even aware of what was your approach and so on is definitely a harder thing to sell, let's say, to your stakeholders.

51:07 - Serban Petrescu
Perfect definition.

51:07 - Serban Petrescu
Yeah, I'm aligned with this approach. So transparency, see what about cases where the stakeholders are trying to push a specific solution on you, because that's another thing. Leaders are very opinionated also about how to do stuff, not only what to do, but how and so on. So if you talk with your leadership stakeholders, you very often may or may not get concrete solutions from them. So how about cases where you get such concrete solutions and you don't agree fundamentally with what they want to push on you? How do you handle situations like that?

51:46 - Lucas Pereira
I'm facing something like this right now. When we finished this, it's a big product view. We have a statement like the target here, it's small and middle business. And like a few months ago, we started to have like large companies with over a thousand employees demanding new features. But we didn't finish the full landscape for this target. We have to be easygoing, showing the definition a few months ago, and showing then it's not to when we say yes for a target, we say no for another target. And when we say yes for every target, we don't solve the full problem of anyone. So it's like I prefer less client using a lot instead of a lot of clients using a bit. So I try to reinforce this statement.

52:44 - Serban Petrescu
Okay, and so I agree with the sentiment and the direction and so on, but I'm also curious to see the concrete way in which you communicate this, because it's very hard to say no to a leader. It's usually or to say, yeah, I'm focusing on this, not on what you care about, especially if you have multiple people have different opinions on what your core focus should be. And this happens as a PM sometimes that you have three different managers, maybe head of marketing, head of sales, head of something else. And each of them thinks their KPI is the most important. Their feature that they want to push on you is the most important.

53:26 - Lucas Pereira
Usually, I try to document the real trade-off. So guys, doing this instead of that, we're going to have for perhaps the lack of this outcome. So I won't lie, this happens with me several times in my life. It is what it is. I work in huge companies. I try to document the trade-off and if sometimes I convince them to keep with this strategy and sometimes no. But when I have the no, I have to document the trade-off so my team and the developers, they won't be pushed about the full outcome three months later. I think this helps to protect the team of maybe a lack of the outcome of the strategy.

54:12 - Serban Petrescu
Got it. Okay. Those were my questions. You mentioned at the beginning that you had a few bullets at the end that you wanted to ask me.

54:25 - Lucas Pereira
We could start with those. I would like to ask In your team, looking to the market, by the book, product manager in your team, for you, what's the difference? What's make the best product manager in your team?

54:43 - Serban Petrescu
Well, I'll answer what would be, what I think would be the best product manager, because I feel like neither of the product managers I have right now, not in my team. Companies we are working with, neither of them has everything. If I could Frankenstein all of them into one single person, we would have a near-perfect product manager. What I feel like is missing is this obsession for understanding the domain deeply and deeply empathizing with your user. Right now, I can give you two examples. We have the learning products where people are working on them, which are like 30, 40 years old, 50 years old, in some cases. And you're very far away from the actual student that right now should be using it, which is a lot younger and primarily in the US. I hope in time we can be outside of the US, but also primarily in the US. They have specific needs and specific wants and whatever. And you can't just, as a 50-year-old or 40-year-old, just design a product for them without empathizing with them. This empathizing with dumb part is sometimes lost completely and I look at the UX and say man this is a second grader he barely knows how to read and you're putting to him a huge wall of text as the tutorial on how to use this thing it's of course he will not read this thing like it's it's clear like obvious things like this are missing perfect and I think like this is the kind of stuff that if you take a random product manager from the industry they'll do the same thing because they are used to this kind of I don't know, just churn out features, don't really deeply think about what your user's headspace is, and it's the same with Crossover. Crossover itself, I feel like we are not doing enough to cater for the candidate himself because the people that are building this have been here for a while. We kind of got used to our mentality in Crossover, but I don't understand that other people outside are not that used to working remotely, not that used to applying in this way where all this stuff is asynchronous done and so on. So I think we are missing this kind of empathy towards the end user and the deep domain knowledge that comes with that empathy because you have to understand how to properly place yourself and how to properly do things to be aligned with what the user needs.

57:11 - Lucas Pereira
And Shobhan, I realize you have a profile of being really straight to the point. I can see this with you. In your opinion, Rumble opinion, what's the lack here? You already gave feedback for improving the profile and didn't work it, or you think you didn't have the space yet for improving this feature as you would like,

57:36 - Serban Petrescu
Yeah, I think it's a no. I think the biggest problem for the current PMs and why I think this role would be better is because they're direction there. I want for this role to tie the success of this role with the success of the outcome. I don't want any other metric. This will be the main metric. How close are we getting to the outcome? I don't care about anything else. Whereas the legacy, let's call the legacy existing product managers, are very tied into politics, into showing the results that they have, the deliverables that they have shipped to to the stakeholders and getting praise for that and stuff like that. That's what they feel they are being judged on. If I will hire a PM and after two months he tells me that my main achievement is that I shipped whatever feature, I'll be like, okay, I completely failed. It makes no sense what we did. But this is the biggest problem. I can't drive a change in the culture in that space because they have conflicting or competing interests that detract them from obsessing about the outcome. And I want to create a role which only has this, nothing else.

58:57 - Lucas Pereira
Just focus on the outcome. Perfect. And it's more a talk about solving real hypotheses of shipping. Really clear. And we are at the time box finishing. I imagine you have another thing. Just a final one. I'd like to say, first of all, I'm really excited with this opportunity. I can imagine it like, I don't know if my best interview and you're the best candidate, but I can guarantee you a lot, a lot of effort, a lot of ownership to quick learning and matching with this profile. I really enjoy everything I saw about the company and about this conversation. I'd like to ask honest feedback from you or what do you think about my profile and what I can improve to fit better?

59:50 - Serban Petrescu
Generally, I answer that via email, because I always feel like we have to give feedback to candidates, and I'm trying to give high-quality feedback, and I think that that requires me to look at the profile, at the interview again, not purely based on the sentiment that I have right now, but I'll give you kind of a sneak peek. So, I think, like, from an experience perspective, you're kind of what I'm searching for. The main kind of point where I would have wanted to see a bit more maybe for the first person at least that I'm hiring on this role is this entrepreneurial experience or startup experience where you actually build a software product that you thought of, that you owned primarily. Of course, you might have investors, might have a co-founder, might have whatever, but to see that you kind of birth a product where you didn't have the safety net of the bank, for example. You had, in both cases, where you started from more or less scratch, like on the insurance side and on this payroll stuff, you had the safety net of the bank. They already had customers trying to drive something for the bank. So that's one area where I feel like, in reality, we'll also have the safety net of the school, for example, for the educational stuff, the safety net of the crossover, for example, for the other products that we might be working for, so they might already have an existing user base. So, in fairness, we also have a similar situation, but I think such a startup founding experience could have helped you sharpen a bit more on your heuristic for reducing the problem space, finding what, or the solution space, finding out what approach makes sense, doesn't make sense. This kind of experience, I feel like that would have helped. So that's one. On the other, being frank here, the only kind of the main concept I have throwing you, for example, on one of our enterprise product sites, because that's another area where it's education, it's crossovers, have enterprise products where we want to build new ancillary products next to the existing products to try to help sales to help retention, to help conversion, to help whatever. There, most of the customers are in the US, and I would be slightly concerned about how they would perceive your English. That's being transparent. Enterprise customers in the US, they generally have this preconceived notion about accent, phrasing, and so on. You do have a clear accent towards Portuguese, for sure, and sometimes phrasing is a bit weird, which for me sounds like a Google Translate version of Portuguese idiom.

1:02:49 - Lucas Pereira
Yeah, I agree.

1:02:51 - Serban Petrescu
So that's why, for example, if I'm thinking now what I would do, I would probably err on the side of placing you on education products because that's more or less kind of a B2C, right, where such an accent doesn't really matter. I mean, if you're talking with a teacher, it doesn't really matter. If you come off as a native English speaker or not, or if you're talking with a student, it's the same. The main thing, the important thing, and kind of the saving grace is that at least in this conversation, I felt like you didn't really miss any point that I made, right? So the high bandwidth was here. We could have a high bandwidth conversation. It's just that sometimes the execution, let's say, on your side of reproducing your thoughts into speech was a bit unpolished. It wasn't a problem to get your point across. That was fine. It's just that the way in which you phrased it was unpolished.

1:03:51 - Lucas Pereira
Perfect. And I totally agree with the feedback. Thank you. And I can commit with you to improve this in English, to improve the accent and everything once we have the opportunity. Because it's a big goal I have. Today, I speak Portuguese like 90% of my time. We have a standard provider, but they are not native speakers as well. They are from different space from Europe. So I totally understand and I believe in this feedback.

1:04:23 - Serban Petrescu
Yeah, I'm sure that this will improve, right? Even for me, it's not perfect. And if I think about five years ago and during COVID, I moved here to crossover. My English was also fairly rusty because in my day to day, I was mostly speaking Romanian. My company was operating mostly in Romania. I would speak English, but like 20% maybe at work. And now I speak a hundred percent English. I have just one guy that is Romanian that I speak.

1:04:53 - Unidentified Speaker
Yes. Yes.

1:04:54 - Serban Petrescu
And then of course, with my, wife and so on, of course, but I was actually telling her one or two weeks ago that I realized that some stuff, especially around work-related concepts, I don't know anymore to explain in Romanian. I'm at the point where it's hard for me, I don't have the vocabulary anymore in Romanian to explain these concepts around AI, for example, and so on. I haven't explained these concepts at all in Romanian, so I don't know how to do it.

1:05:24 - Unidentified Speaker
Makes sense, clear.

1:05:25 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah.

1:05:26 - Serban Petrescu
OK, good. So you have the commitment from my side that when you get the answer, which will be probably tomorrow or on Friday, today's Wednesday, right? Yeah, I see. So on Friday, probably you'll get the answer, yes or no. And if it's a yes, then we'll schedule a call with one of the stakeholders such that you can see also how you would, let's say, vibe with one of the stakeholders from the actual sister company. But in any case, if it's a yes or a no, you'll anyway get feedback from me. So it will be more, I hope, more insightful than what I could reproduce right now.

1:06:07 - Lucas Pereira
It was great. You were great.

1:06:10 - Unidentified Speaker
I enjoyed it.

1:06:11 - Serban Petrescu
Okay.

1:06:12 - Serban Petrescu
I'm happy to hear that.

1:06:14 - Lucas Pereira
Yeah, it was great, really, honestly. And thank you for the opportunity. I learned a lot talking with you. And I'm really excited with this opportunity. Thank you again. Thank you.

1:06:25 - Serban Petrescu
Thank you, too.

1:06:26 - Serban Petrescu
Have a nice rest of the day. And if you have any more questions, feel free to drop me a line. You have my email address in the invites. I am here for any kind of question that you might have. If you think about the interview, I'm sure you might.

1:06:41 - Lucas Pereira
You'll think about something, probably.

1:06:43 - Serban Petrescu
OK. I will. Yeah. Awesome. OK. So thank you very much. Have a nice rest of the day.

1:06:48 - Lucas Pereira
Thank you. You too. Bye-bye. See you. You
</interview>

<interview-chat>
User: Hi
Assistant: Hello! I'm an interviewer here to evaluate your qualifications for a product leadership role. To start, could you please share one or two relevant experiences from your background where you personally shaped the product vision, defined the roadmap, owned the core problem-solution hypothesis, and improved it based on usage metrics or customer feedback? This role requires at least 4 years of experience in that type of product leadership capacity.
User: I owned the product vision from the start, we identified that SMBs owners were stuggling with gragmented workflows between time tracking, payroll, and payments. I defined the roadmap based on the hypothesis that embedding these functions into our financial platform would simplify operations and drive retention.

We launched a MVP and itarated quickly based on real user feedback. For instante, we learned that payroll report generation was a major pain point, so we simplified how time events were categorized, that cut processing time in a half.

I worked closely with design and eng. team to prototype, test and ship improvements on a biweekly cycle. Over time, usage double and we saw a significant reduction in customer support volume, validating the impact.

This was a great example of full product ownership, from vision to continuous interating, and how data and user insight guided every step of the process
Assistant: Thank you for sharing that detailed experience. It sounds like you had full end-to-end ownership of shaping and evolving that product vision based on real user feedback and metrics. A few follow-up questions:

- How many total years were you in that product leadership role for that particular product?
- Can you provide some quantitative metrics around the usage growth and customer support reduction you mentioned, even rough estimates?
- What were your specific responsibilities in defining the roadmap and prioritizing what made it into each release?

Getting some more specifics will help me fully evaluate if this experience meets the 4+ year product leadership requirement for this role. The level of ownership and iteration you described so far sounds quite relevant.
User: Ive held product leadership responsabilities for over 5 years, including full ownership of strategy, roadmap and delivery in cross-functional teams.

On the payroll/HR product specifically, Im almost 2 years.

- About the metrics, a 50% reduction in time to run payroll, 2x increase in weekly active usage

- My responsabilities included defining product hypotheses, prioritizing features based on impact/effort, writing release briefs, validating problems with customers, and partnering with design and engineering to build and ship solutions

I also worked with data analysts to track adoption and impact after each release, usage data, feedback themes, and error rate trends were key inputs to the roadmap

Assistant: Thank you for providing those additional details. It helps give me a clear picture that this experience does meet the 4+ year product leadership requirement for this role. A few key points:

- You had over 5 years total in product leadership roles with full ownership
- Specifically on the payroll/HR product, you had almost 2 years leading it
- You defined the vision, roadmap, prioritized features, and worked cross-functionally to ship and iterate
- You tracked quantitative metrics like 50% reduced payroll time, 2x usage growth to validate impact

Having that level of product leadership experience, with a data-driven approach to validating the problem/solution fit, aligns well with what we're looking for. I have a good understanding of how you meet the first requirement. Let's move on to discussing experience taking a product from concept to launch. Can you describe a time when you launched a new software product completely from scratch that went on to achieve market success?
User: We designed the MVP to test one core hypothesis: that embedding HR and payroll functions directly into our financial platform would simplify operations for SMBs. Before rolling out broadly, we ran a closed pilot with 40 companies and used Sean Ellis Score/Market Fit Score to assess traction

Over 60% of participants answered that they would be "very disappointed" if the product were taken away, a strong sign of product-market fit. We also collected qualitative feedback and NPS to shape improvements before going to market.

As we rolled out to a larger base, we maintained that score above 40%, which gave us confidence to expand agressively. Matching the PMF validation with the rollout helped us avoid wasting resources and ensured adoption from day one

This approach, combining score-based validation, real user feedback and gradual rollout, was key to launching with strong fit and scaling efficiently
Assistant: Thank you for walking through that product launch experience in detail. I appreciate you covering the specific validation methods used like the Sean Ellis market fit score, NPS, and phased rollout approach. A few clarifying questions:

- Was this an entirely new stand-alone product launch, or an added module/feature to an existing product?
- What were the actual usage/revenue metrics that defined the market success after the broader rollout?
- How long was the end-to-end process from initial concept to getting that market validation and broader launch?

Getting clarity on those points will help me assess if this meets the requirement of taking a full software product from true zero-to-one and achieving market success, versus incrementally adding a new feature. The validation process you described sounds robust.
User: Yes, was a new stand-alone solution, but embedded into our core product (Conta Stone), making a bundled offer. It required building a new experience from scratch, but tightly integrated with the existing business account.

The main metrics we tracked were: adoption (number of clients actively using the product), SaaS revenue (we charged R$5.99 per employee), and NPS scores from early users to assess satisfaction fit

We signed our first client within 3 months of development kickoff, and by the 6th month we had over 40 active clients using the product, which helped validade product-market-fit ahead of a broader rollout
Assistant: Thank you for clarifying those additional details. Based on your explanation, it does seem this experience meets the requirement of taking a new, standalone software product from concept all the way through to successful market launch and adoption. A few key points:

- It was a new, bundled solution built from scratch, not just a feature addition
- You had clear metrics tracking real usage adoption and revenue from the new product
- The timeline of 6 months from kickoff to having 40+ active paid customers validates getting it to market success
- Using methods like NPS and limiting initial rollout helped validate product-market fit before scaling

Having taken a new software product through that full cycle, defining the opportunity, building it from zero, validating with a limited launch, and then scaling it out to market success checks the important boxes for this requirement. Unless you have any other background to add regarding this experience, I have what I need to evaluate it.

Let's move on to discussing your experience, if any, in the enterprise software space - things like ERP, CRM, SCM, business intelligence, workflow/BPM platforms and related technologies for larger organizations. Can you describe any relevant experience you have in that domain?
User: Conta Stone is a business banking account, but it also includes embedded management solutions, like HR and payroll, designed to support over 800.000 active clients across Brazil. Previously, I worked on a similar B2B product at Itau, where I was part of the team behind their platform, which supported over 1.5 million clients. This gave me strong exposure to building scalable solutions for SMBs in highly regulated environments, working with large user bases and legacy banking infrastructure
Assistant: Thank you for sharing those examples from your background working on business banking and management solutions at Conta Stone and previously at Itau. A couple follow up questions:

- At either of those companies, did you specifically work on products that would be considered classic "enterprise software" categories like ERP, CRM, SCM, business intelligence, workflow/BPM platforms? Or were they more focused on banking/financial products?

- What were some of the biggest challenges you faced in those roles in terms of scaling the solutions to meet enterprise needs around performance, security, compliance, etc.?

Getting more specifics on if the products squarely fell into those core enterprise software domains, and examples of how you had to approach enterprise-scale requirements, will help me fully evaluate your experience for this particular requirement. The background you described so far sounds relevant, but I want to ensure I understand the full scope.
User: Thats correct, the products I worked on at both Stone and Itau were more focused on banking and financial operations. However, within that landscape, I've had direct experience working on broader solutions that intersect with other domains like insurance, beyond banking, payroll and HR platforms.

Each product I worked on had strict compliance requirements, especially in banking and now in HR/payroll. Scalability and compliance were build into the product from day one. Working in large companies made it clear: scale securely isnt optional - its the baseline
Assistant: Thank you for clarifying the scope of your enterprise software experience. I have a good understanding now that while the products were primarily in the banking/fintech domain, you had to deal with many enterprise-scale requirements and challenges around compliance, security, scalability, and integrating with adjacent domains like insurance and HR/payroll platforms.

Even though the products themselves may not have been classic ERP, CRM, or workflow automation tools, it sounds like you gained valuable experience building solutions that had to meet those same enterprise-grade needs. Having that mindset and experience baked into your approach from the start is applicable.

Unless you have any other specific enterprise software experience to add, I believe I have enough context to evaluate your background against this particular requirement.

Overall, based on the experiences you've walked me through, it seems you have a strong background that checks the key boxes we're looking for:

1) 4+ years of product leadership owning the full vision, roadmap, and metrics-driven iteration
2) Taking at least one new software product from concept through validation to successful market launch
3) Relevant enterprise-scale experience building secure, compliant solutions for large customer bases

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience in-depth. This has been helpful for me to fully evaluate your fit for the role. Is there any other background you'd like to provide before we wrap up? If not, I can proceed with delivering my final evaluation.
User: You can proceed

You are applying for the following role.

<jd>
**Job Description**   
You’ve had experience taking a software product from zero to launch, but you know that deep, thoughtful product work doesn’t end. You’re the kind of person who figures things out without a map, who goes deep on understanding the user, the problem, and the domain until a clear path emerges. You don’t want to manage a backlog or fill in a spec. You want ownership of a goal that matters and the space to pursue it with speed, insight, and focus.

At Trilogy, we’re flipping the model. You’re not here to “own the roadmap”. You’re here to make one thing true: a real-world, measurable business outcome. You get one clear goal—something that should happen when users interact with the product—and your job is to make it happen. You’ll need to build deep domain insights using AI as your peer and feedback from users, codify them so that both your teammates and AI can act on it, and steer the product through fast, data-backed iterations until you hit the outcome.

You’ll be joining a team that doesn’t celebrate busywork or beautiful process diagrams. You’ll be there to drive impact and make decisions rooted in user data, fast feedback loops, and sharp insight. If you’re sick of playing the PM game and want to actually change the game, please apply. We’re building what product management should have been all along.

**What you will be doing**

* Build BrainLifts: A structured, evolving body of expert insights that sharpens AI tools, guides decisions, and proves you understand the domain.  
* Make Product Iterations: Small, data-driven product enhancements shipped weekly to steer the product toward a measurable outcome.  
* Building Domain Expertise: Acquire deep, structured understanding of a specific domain so that the team can make higher-quality decisions, create more tailored outputs, and communicate with authority.

**What you will NOT be doing**

* Spending a whole month developing a new feature; we aim to ship new features on a weekly basis  
* Writing lengthy and exhaustive PRDs, managing backlogs, or defining every screen or edge case  
* Building technical solutions or software architecture

**Key responsibilities**

* Make product outcomes that need to happen, actually happen, and prove it with backing data.

**Candidate requirements**

* At least 4 years in a product leadership role where they personally shaped the product vision, defined the roadmap, owned the core problem-solution hypothesis, and improved it based on usage metrics or customer feedback.  
* launching at least one successful product (not just a feature or a module) that reached real users (not internal tools) from scratch (not joining partway through the development process)  
* Previous experience in product management in the enterprise software space  
* Enthusiasm for using AI in your daily work (e.g., research, analysis, synthesis, or strategy)
