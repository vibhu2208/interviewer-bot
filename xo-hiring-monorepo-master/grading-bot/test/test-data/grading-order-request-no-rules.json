            "answer": "From about the time I could walk, I have been involved in sports. Eagerly taking on the mental and physical challenges they provide. Growing up, athletics was not only an outlet but a deep passion of mine. Volleyball quickly became the sport I was dedicating all my time to and I loved every second of it. The older I got, the more competitive it became. By the time I was 14, I had been fortunate enough to have earned a scholarship to play on my city's most competitive traveling club volleyball team. I came from a family with very different financial circumstances than the rest of my teammates and knew that the only way I would ever be able to play on this team was by means of this scholarship. Constantly aware of the financial blessing this scholarship was. At this point, I truly believed that I was not taking anything for granted, and continued developing in my volleyball career. The summer after my sophomore year of high school, I started to notice my health begin to decline. I was losing weight, lethargy, and extreme health issues began to arise. \\r\\n\\r\\nSchool and daily practices were quickly replaced with doctor visits and scans, and I found myself in a hospital gown more often than not. I had gone from being one of the healthiest and strongest kids to not being medically cleared for sports at all. I was hardly leaving my bed and needed assistance with tasks I could have previously done with ease. Walking down the stairs in my home, and feeling well enough to attend my classes became a rare occurrence and my high school experience was soon very different than it once had been. Nothing could have prepared me for the physical and mental toll that being chronically ill would bring. My whole life up until that point, I had taken my healthy body for granted. My complaints consisted of how sore I was, aches, injuries, how tired I was from workouts etc. Not realizing how fortunate I was to have a body that was able to push itself to those limits in order to feel that way. My whole perspective changed and I no longer thought of training and practice as an obligation, but a privilege that I wished to have back. \\r\\n\\r\\nFriends at my high school grew concerned as I was there less than half of the time. A friend and old training partner of mine reached out to me asking if I would like to come work out with them. They stated they had seen my demeanor change and could tell that not having sports was impacting me even on the days I felt okay. I quickly told them I would not be able to keep up and shut the idea down. I tried to explain that my muscles had atrophied extensively and there was little I was medically cleared for. They assured me that we would start off with exercises resembling physical therapy movements, and I had nothing to worry about. Reluctantly, I agreed. \\r\\n\\r\\n4 A.M. Every day my friend came to my house and helped me through my banded workouts and seemingly simple movements. Over time, I went from resistance bands and therapeutic stretches to adding some weight and coordination back into the movements. Not only was I advancing in the exercise plan, but my lab results were starting to fall within normal range, my symptoms began to lessen, and my school attendance became more and more regular. After about a year of working together and keeping each other accountable for our daily workouts, I was finally cleared to play sports again. \\r\\n\\r\\nI will never forget the feeling of being able to step back into a space that had provided so much to my life. From that moment forward, I promised myself I would never take having an able body for granted ever again. Exercise became an even bigger passion for me than ever as I immersed myself back into the world of being an athlete. I now trained twice as hard every day leading up to volleyball season. resulting in the best scores I had ever achieved at a tryout even prior to being sick. Setting these personal records and making the traveling team after coming back from an illness, gave me the confidence I needed. After this, I set the goal of trying out for the junior Olympic team while in Colorado for a tournament. I knew that my work ethic and drive were something that could not be taken from me, and I relentlessly trained until the time for the tryout came. After several hours of drills and exercises, I learned that I had been selected for the team and that would play in Brazil. I was overwhelmed with emotion as it had been such a long and unsure journey to get there. \\r\\n\\r\\nDue to my family's financial situation, I was unable to join my team and make the trip to compete in Brazil. However, the confidence and appreciation I gained for my body have stuck with me throughout my life. My relentless work ethic and remaining consistent allowed me to heal my body in ways my doctors were unable to. To me, hard work means that obstacles only slow down the process not halt it entirely. While I don't think hard work itself is quantifiable, the benefits of hard work are, and they will usually speak for themselves. This experience led me to pursue my degrees in fields relating to body mechanics and exercise, in hopes of being able to create a healthier and more empowered generation to come."
